## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a weather app that allowed the user to enter a city name and get the current weather conditions plus an extended five day forecast. The app was to show multiple weather conditions, aided by icons and color coding. The app allows the user to have a list of previously searched locations that can then be used to check those conditions again with just a click.

## Installation
